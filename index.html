          <p>I am a New York City-based writer, photographer, and multimedia producer. I am trained as a cultural
            journalist with expertise in literature and visual studies. I have written reviews for The Post and Courier,
            quirky pieces for Time Out New York, and produced Wikipedia entries on art for the Guggenheim.</p>
          <p>I started my career as a copywriter, creating 360-degree campaigns for global brands such as Panasonic,
            Yamaha, Alstom, and the Government of India. I am proficient in writing copy for print advertisements,
            scripting television commercials, feature films, and radio jingles. I have experience curating click worthy
            digital content for social media across channels aimed at diverse audiences. </p>
          <p>I have completed courses in visual storytelling from the School of Visual Arts; filmmaking from New York
            University; and am learning to code from Columbia University. I feel that the way people will interact with
            stories, whether news articles or books, is about to undergo a radical change in the future. Being equipped
            with skills to combine new-age technology with an engaging voice as a writer is my current goal. I have
            continued to learn even after graduating as an arts journalist from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public
            Communications at Syracuse University.
          <p>Below you will be able to see the projects I created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, NodeJS, MySql and
            Mongoose during a fullstack coding bootcamp at Columbia Univeristy. The first tab in each project will take
            you to the LIVE URL where the app is deployed and the second tab, which contains a screenshot of the
            application, will also take you to the Github repo where the project exists. </p>
